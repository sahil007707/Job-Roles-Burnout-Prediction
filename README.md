# Job Roles Burnout Prediction & EDA Analysis

This project focuses on predicting employee burnout based on various job-related factors using machine learning and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from the dataset. 

## Project Overview

1. **Job Roles Burnout Prediction Analysis**
   - In this part of the project, we aim to predict employee burnout using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
   - The dataset contains various features such as age, gender, job role, experience, and stress level, which are used to predict the target variable `burnout`.
   - The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

2. **Job Roles Burnout EDA Analysis**
   - The EDA part of the project focuses on visualizing and analyzing the dataset to better understand the relationships between the features and the burnout rate.
   - Visualizations such as bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots are used to examine the distribution of various features and their correlation with burnout.
